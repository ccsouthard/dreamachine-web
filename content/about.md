description_right_column = "Alpha waves are often present during relaxation exercises, daydreaming or in the practice of mindfulness. Some studies have even shown that simply walking through the woods can increase Alpha band production.<br><br>Concurrently, Alpha waves are also useful to those suffering from depression. Researchers suppose people with depressive symptoms are engaged in repetitive thought processes. If Alpha wave production is enhanced with flickering light; depression may be reduced with a noninvasive and inexpensive treatment to enhance well-being."

[brain_entrainment.left_column]
description = "Flickering light alters our brain’s natural electrical frequencies and our brainwaves begin to mimic the chosen frequency. Sound in certain frequencies can also entrain the brain to mimic the desired state of consciousness.<br><br>This is called brain entrainment. The entrainment principal is the tendency for any two oscillating bodies to synchronize. &nbsp;When our closed eyes receive 10 flickers per second, the optic nerve triggers signals in the brain’s cortical region to induce alpha waves at 10Hz.<br><br>In a similar way as flickering light, sound and music can also stimulate our brains to mimic specific frequencies and become aligned to beats. &nbsp; This phenomenon can be used to induce focus, sleep, meditation, hypnagogic and trance-like states."

[brain_entrainment.right_column]
description = "In 1666, the physicist Christian Huygens coined the term ‘entrainment’, &nbsp; after a period of time observing two pendulum clocks. The pendulums that originally moved in different directions began to maintain the same rhythm the pendulums stabilized.<br><br>Research has determined that subtle amounts of energy are transferred between the two pendulums when they are out of sync. This produces a negative feedback. To reduce the amount of energy transferred, a stable relationship is formed and the pendulums then swing in synchronicity."

description = "Ancient tribal shamans have used drum and rattles to beat frequencies alongside a flickering fire as a primary doorway to enter altered states of consciousness.

Binaural beats may be a powerful way to alter your brainwaves and induce desired states of consciousness.<br><br>Studies have shown that research participants’ meditation EEG patterns are comparable with listening to binaural beats in the Alpha and Theta bands."

Salvador Dali frequently derived inspiration between sleeping and waking and considered it a secret of magic craftsmanship. He referred to it as “the slumber with the key.”<br><br>The word is derived from the Greek words “sleep” and “guide.” &nbsp; Often in Theta and Alpha brainwave frequencies you will see flying colors and visual imagery pulled from layers of memories and sensations. It is a free-flowing, associative state and scientifically is still in uncharted territory."
