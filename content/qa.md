description = "Pulsing light alters our brain’s natural electrical frequencies and our brain begins to mimic this frequency (Landgraf, 2003). This is called brain entrainment. The entrainment principal is the tendency for any two oscillating bodies to synchronize.<br><br>When our closed eyes receive 10 flickers per second, the optic nerve triggers signals in the cortical region to induce Alpha waves."

description = "The hypnagogic state and is defined as the place the mind travels between sleeping and ordinary consciousness.Some artists believe that the dreamachine helps to rearrange patterns of the unconscious mind and bring the practitioner to a place between memory and pure consciousness.<br><br>This region of consciousness has been referred to in the writings from Aristotle to Edgar Allan Poe."

description = "<br>- <strong>Delta- (0-4 Hz) </strong> This frequency is associated with deep sleep. This wavelength occurs in the frontal brain region. Some believe that the human growth hormone is released during this frequency and often healing occurs.<br><br>- <strong>Theta- (4-7 Hz) </strong>This wavelength has been connected to dreaming, stress reduction, creativity, meditation and consciousness. Sometimes we experience this frequency when we are awakened in a dream (lucid dream). This is the range where learning and memory occurs. Extended periods of Theta waves strengthen pre-frontal cortex fibers.<br><br>- <strong>Alpha- (8-12 Hz)</strong><span class=\"s1\"> </span>This frequency is associated with conscious awareness, meditation, deep relaxation, and is a doorway towards deeper states of consciousness. It also corresponds with the same resonant frequency of our planet’s electromagnetic field.<br><br>- <strong>Beta- (13-40 Hz)</strong> Beta waves are connected to our task oriented concentration. They also correlate to intense concentration, alertness, and optic clarity. Nobel prizewinner Sir Francis Crick believed that this frequency corresponds to the act of cognition.<br><br>- <strong>Gamma- (40-100) </strong>Gamma waves are hypothesized to be important in uniting our conscious perception. It has been thought that these waves begin in the thalamus and jumps between various neural circuits. There is no definitive scientific consensus on these brain frequencies at present (Lieberman, 2009)."

description = "Mindful meditation is the conscious practice of attending to our breathing. The mind during mindfulness meditation is aware of its flashing thought process; whether we notice our waves of breath, the space between sound and silence or the distinction between sensation and numbness.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br><br>These mental aggregates or mind manifestations are all composed of an action or non-action, an on and an off switch, an inhalation and an exhalation, a stimulus and response."

description = "Brain waves are the observable electric, neural activity that we refer to as “thinking.” When we ‘hear’, ‘see’, ‘touch’, and ‘taste’, our neural waves change frequencies. Every second of every day, our brains are filled with this bustling electrical activity.<br><br>Brain waves can also be understood as the on and off firings of billions of neurons.<br><br><span class=\"s1\">Brain waves are alert whether we are sleeping or resting, moving or thinking. Frequencies are the brain waves’ speed and are measured in hertz (Hz). As we engage with the environment, our senses transmit data through electrical signals to our brains. </span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></span><span class=\"s1\">We understand these signals as information. In our daily lives (99% of awake activity) our brain stays within the Beta and Gamma bands. Before we slip into sleep, there is a brief moment in time when we relax and enter Alpha wave activity.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></span><span class=\"s1\">Researchers utilize EEGs (electroencephalography) to record brain waves. To produce a “brain print,” or EEG reading, electrodes are placed on a special hat that measures wave frequencies.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><br><br></span>"

description = "<span class=\"s1\">In a recent meditation study, electrical brain waves were measured using an EEG. This study at Sydney University in Australia compared meditative practice to relaxation (only eyes closed). Brainwave activity was monitored in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br><br><span class=\"s1\">During meditation, it was determined that Alpha and Theta waves were active in the frontal and middle parts of brain. Alpha waves are elicited in the posterior of the brain during meditation.<br><br>Increased alpha wave bands led to a relaxed brain state. It has been found that people who practice meditation demonstrate increased frequency of these particular brain waves (The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 2010).<br><br>Dartmouth researchers suggest after reviewing neuro-imaging studies that our brains are constantly searching for patterns. The default brain activity of the brain is spontaneous wandering. It is thought that this mental processing helps us to reframe memory, add emotional color and search for order.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></span><span class=\"s1\">As previously mentioned, we activate Beta waves when we begin to think of our to-do list, plan an action, create a goal or look back upon a pertinent event or topic. It has been shown that very few Beta waves are generated during meditation. This is because non-directive meditation helps the brain relax by letting thoughts, to-do lists, emotions pass without direct attachment (The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 2010).<br><br>Increased activation of Alpha and Theta waves has been found in people who have strong meditative practices. It has been implied that meditation changes the way our brain allocates attention.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;<br><br></span><span class=\"s1\">Cahn and Polich (2006) compared neural electric results with neuro-imaging binding images. They determined that meditation has an effect within the Alpha band as both a state and a trait effect.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><br><br></span><span class=\"s1\">A state change refers to an alteration of self-referential, cognitive, and sensory awareness that arises during meditative practice, whereas dimensions that persist after practice is referred to as trait (Cahn &amp; Polich, 2006). This means that Alpha band frequencies are increased during and after meditation.<br><br>Clinical application of meditation in conjunction with other forms of therapy could have a strong collaborative effect. Meditation clearly affects CNS functioning, however, the exact neural changes and differences from various practices are far from understood (Cahn &amp; Polich, 2006).<br></span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><br></span><span class=\"s1\">Other measures that have not been determined are how individuals differ in neural electric changes; various individuals could have different degrees of constitutional practice.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><br><br><br><br><br><br></span>"

description = "<span class=\"s1\">New experiences promote the formation of new neural pathways otherwise known as neuroplasticity. In essence as we stretch our comfort zones, explore new experiences, delve into virgin territory, and try new things our brains expand and develop and are pruned much like an ornamental shrub.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></span><span class=\"s1\">While this is purely conjecture, increased Alpha wave bands incited by the Dreamachine could lead to a thicker cortex. Alpha bands may promote neuro-plasticity because we are engaging an electric response that is creating a new experience.</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></span><span class=\"s1\">In a recent study Dr. Marion Diamond conducted an experiment in which she exposed different groups of rats to different environments. In one environment, a group of rats were exposed to different settings and increased variables. </span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></span><span class=\"s1\">The other group of rats had only one experience and only one environment. After technical analysis, it was found that the rats that were exposed to different environments had increased learning ability, brain mass, and dendrite growth than the control group. In addition, Dr. Diamond found a correlation between the cohort of rats that were stimulated by different environments and an increased immune response (Budzynski, 2010).</span>"
