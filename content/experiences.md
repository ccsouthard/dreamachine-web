quote = " “Vision start with a kaleidoscope of colors on a plane in front of the eyes and gradually become more complex and beautiful, looking like the surf on the shore until whole patterns of color are pounding to get in. After a while the visions were permanently behind my eyes and I was in the middle of the whole scene with limitless patterns generated around me. ”"
