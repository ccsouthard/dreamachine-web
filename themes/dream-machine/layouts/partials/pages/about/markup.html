    <div class="aboutPage__alphaWaves__description">
      <p>Researchers have found a correlation between Alpha brain waves and
        creative thinking either through mindfulness meditation, transcendental
        meditation or electrical stimulation.</p>
      <p>Alpha waves are often present during relaxation exercises, daydreaming
        or in the practice of mindfulness. Some studies have even shown that simply
        walking through the woods can increase Alpha band production.</p>
      <p>In a recent study, out of the University of North Carolina, a low-dose
        electric current of 10 Hz was noted for enhancing Alpha brain wave activity
        and boosting creativity by 7.4%.</p>
      <p>Concurrently, Alpha waves are also useful to those suffering from depression.
        Researchers suppose people with depressive symptoms are engaged in  repetitive
        thought processes. If Alpha wave production is enhanced with flickering light;
        depression may be reduced with a noninvasive and inexpensive treatment to enhance well-being.</p>
